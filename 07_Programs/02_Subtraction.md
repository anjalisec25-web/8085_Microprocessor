# Subtraction of Two 8-bit Numbers

## Aim

To subtract one 8-bit number from another using the 8085 microprocessor.

## Algorithm

1. Load the first number into the accumulator.
2. Load the second number into a register.
3. Subtract the second number from the first.
4. Store the result.
5. Stop the program.

## Program

```assembly
LDA 2500H
MOV B, A
LDA 2501H
SUB B
STA 2502H
HLT
```

## Explanation

| Instruction | Description |

| LDA 2500H | Load first number |
| MOV B, A | Save first number in B |
| LDA 2501H | Load second number |
| SUB B | Subtract B from A |
| STA 2502H | Store result |
| HLT | Stop execution |
